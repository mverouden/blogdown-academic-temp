#     Internship to fulfill my BSc. studies in Analytical and Environmental Analytical Chemistry. During this period I worked in a research and development department of the laboratory. The goal of the department was to develop new analysis methods for and support the production laboratory in any way possible. I researched a screening method for the determination of the biochemical oxygen demand, which is a measure for biodegradable organic compounds in (waste)water. My graduation project involved miniaturization and implementation of microwave digestion of water samples for the determination of mercury.
